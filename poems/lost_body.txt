My body as a weapon,
Sometimes fires the wrong way.
Requires forces who do not handle it properly.
My body as a weapon, sometimes takes up friendly fire.
All the while I am at a loss as to whether I should rejoice or apologize.
Wish that I knew more words to accurately convey the right meaning for once.
My body, dressed in sheer purple, illuminated by silken flames-
hang from my silhouette, swings low from my silhouette.
Boys’ a body too, taken down by my own.
Shadowy fingers trace the outskirts of this body, can’t say I feel.
The sentiment all the same, even if the torsos have (but) slightly changed.
My body does not asked to be named (although it should)-
remaining nameless, spilt milk is what it always is, tragic little reminder that it is.
Much more prone to a sad sickness that it sometimes forgets-
takes on all shapes, moves in dangerous ways,
preferring the deeper darkness that binds a moth, binds the bee.
Binds me.
A sick sadness that holds my body down farther- binds me deeper.
My body as a tool, my body never as it is, My body.
